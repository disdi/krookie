1. Analyze the userspace program (syscall.c) and discover what it does

2. Analyze arch/arm/kernel/sys_arm.c in kernel sources and fill the blanks
as instructed inline

3. Rebuild the kernel

Remember about ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

4. Try running ./syscall in the virtual machine

	./syscall -p <number> to put element into buffer
	./syscall -g to get element from buffer
	You might need to put either into background with &
	(e.g. while getting from empty buffer)

When trying to get from empty buffer the process will sleep waiting
on the semaphore. If you don't put the process into background you
have no other shell available to put the element into buffer.
Converse situation happens when trying to put into full buffer.
